# Jupyter Notebook Files:
### DataFromReuters.ipynb:

This is the notebook file to create and save Reuters documents in the data folder.

### RNN_SLM.ipynb:

This file contains the recurrent neural network and the functions to generate text.

**Remarks:**
Make sure to install Pytorch on your computer. Having an Nvidia GPU will help. I am assuming that all the packages are in place.
